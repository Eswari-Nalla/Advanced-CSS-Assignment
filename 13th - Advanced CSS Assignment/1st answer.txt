The var() function is part of CSS3. It allows users to access custom properties, such as color: var(--primary-color);. 

CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that users can:
1. Create variables with local or global scope
2. Change the variables with JavaScript
3. Change the variables based on media queries 

The var() function can be used to apply CSS variables to HTML. For example, users can create a set of custom red, green, and blue variables, and then apply those variables to boxes using the var() function.
